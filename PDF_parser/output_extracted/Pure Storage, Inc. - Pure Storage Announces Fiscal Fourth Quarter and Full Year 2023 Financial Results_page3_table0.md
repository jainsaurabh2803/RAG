|    | Leadership in Sustainability: Pure released the first environmental impact analysis of its          |    |
|    | portfolio, which found that Pure's products can use as little as one-fifth the power of             |    |
|    | competitive storage offerings. Pure also introduced the first-of-it's-kind Energy Efficiency SLA    |    |

|    | to differ materially from these statements. Pure has not reconciled its guidance for non-GAAP       |    |
|    | operating margin to its most directly comparable GAAP measure because certain items that impact     |    |
|    | this measure are not within Pure's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a    |    |
|    | reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure        |    |
|    | is not available without unreasonable effort.                                                       |    |
