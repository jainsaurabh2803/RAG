|    | Subscription ARR is a key business metric that refers to total annualized contract value of all active |    |
|    | subscription agreements on the last day of the quarter, plus on-demand revenue for the quarter         |    |
|    | multiplied by four.                                                                                    |    |
|    | Total Contract Value (TCV) Sales, or bookings, of Pure's Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex            |    |
|    | offerings is an operating metric, representing the value of orders received and/or expected to be      |    |
|    | received during the fiscal year.                                                                       |    |
|    | Non-GAAP Financial Measures                                                                            |    |
|    | To supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared            |    |
|    | and presented in accordance with GAAP, Pure uses the following non-GAAP financial measures:            |    |
|    | non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP               |    |
|    | operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, and free           |    |
|    | cash flow.                                                                                             |    |
|    | We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a        |    |
|    | means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP            |    |
|    | financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and           |    |
|    | liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures such as stock-based compensation              |    |
|    | expense, payments to former shareholders of acquired companies, payroll tax expense related to         |    |
|    | stock-based activities, amortization of debt issuance costs related to debt, amortization of           |    |
|    | intangible assets acquired from acquisitions, acquisition-related transaction and integration          |    |
|    | expenses, restructuring costs related to severance and termination benefits, and costs associated      |    |
|    | with the impairment and early exit of certain leased facilities that may not be indicative of our      |    |
|    | ongoing core business operating results. Pure believes that both management and investors              |    |
|    | benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and           |    |
|    | when analyzing historical performance and liquidity and planning, forecasting, and analyzing future    |    |
|    | periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in        |    |
|    | isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our       |    |
|    | non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by oGthEeTr ScoTAmRpaTnEiDes N. OW      |    |
|    | For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures, please see the             |    |
